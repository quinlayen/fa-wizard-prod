3.   USING FA WIZARDTM:

The client agrees to use FA WizardTM only for lawful purposes and in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  FA Experts¬Æ may suspend or terminate access for any violation of these Terms by the client or any of the client‚Äôs employees or agents.

6.   PAYMENTS:

The client‚Äôs subscription includes access to FA WizardTM, including access to the school data platform and public-facing web outputs.  Access is contingent upon continuous current payment status.  All billing information must be accurate and kept up to date.  FA Experts¬Æ may use third-party services to process payments securely.

7.   TERM:
The term of this Agreement shall begin on the date that the subscription is initiated by the client through the fawizard.com website, with services to begin as soon as practical.  It shall remain binding on both parties until the end of the monthly payment period in which the client makes formal notice of cancellation, or FA Experts¬Æ cancels the agreement for violation of the Terms and Conditions. The provisions of Section 8 through Section 19 (below) of these Terms and Conditions are perpetual and survive notwithstanding the termination of the agreement and/or services.

8.   NO AGENCY, PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE CREATED:
FA Experts¬Æ and the client agree that the relationship between them is that of client and technology provider, that neither party shall have any authority to represent or bind the other, and that neither party shall hold itself out or have any authority as an agent of the other for any purpose whatsoever.  Nothing herein shall be construed as creating a principal and agent, joint venture, or any other type of relationship between the client, the educational institution, or any employee/principal of the educational institution and FA Experts¬Æ. 

9.  STATUS AS A ‚ÄúTHIRD PARTY SERVICER‚Äù AND LIMITATION ON SCOPE OF SERVICES:
By nature, FA WizardTM is NOT a ‚Äúthird-party servicer‚Äù arrangement under federal regulation 34CFR668.2 (specifically, the definition of a third-party servicer).  Expressly, no product, employee, or contractor of FA Experts¬Æ shall engage in any activity which would qualify as ‚Äúadminister(ing), through either manual or automated processing, any aspect of the institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program‚Äù, and/or as ‚Äúperforming any function required by any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA‚Äù.  

All products, text, and/or intellectual content provided by FA Experts¬Æ are strictly advisory in nature, and all management decisions, policy changes, administrative actions, and processing functions must be performed by employees of the client, including editing, approval, and implementation of any documents and/or text provided by FA Experts¬Æ.

10.  OWNERSHIP AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:
All aspects of FA WizardTM, including all text, formatting, layouts, and computer software are the intellectual property of Financial Aid Experts, Inc. (FA Experts¬Æ), and are protected by U.S. and international copyrights.   The Client understands, agrees, and commits that FA Experts¬Æ is the exclusive owner of all such intellectual property and all rights related to that content.  During the Term of the client‚Äôs FA WizardTM subscription, FA Experts¬Æ grants the client a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, maintain, modify, or revise the provided intellectual property solely for the client‚Äôs own administrative use.  However, the client hereby agrees that, except as necessary to use the property for its regular operations and/or to comply with applicable laws and regulations, the client shall not disclose, market, sell, lease, distribute or otherwise provide license to the intellectual property to any other institution, entity, affiliated school, consultant, third-party servicer, corporation, partnership, or individual without prior written consent from FA Experts¬Æ.

The term ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù and ‚Äúproperty‚Äù includes (but is not limited to):  the text, layout, and formatting of policy and procedure statements, the text of all system-generated web pages, provided sample documents, standardized forms, electronic applications, software, web applications, policy manual design and table of contents, training materials, and any other outputs of the FA WizardTM product.  The term ‚ÄúIntellectual Property Rights‚Äù shall mean any intellectual property or proprietary rights, including, without limitation, copyright rights (including rights in audiovisual works), moral rights, trademarks (including logos, slogans, domain names, trade names, service marks), rights of privacy and publicity, patent rights (including patent applications and disclosures), know-how, inventions, rights of priority, and trade secret rights, recognized in the United States and/or any country or jurisdiction in the world.

11.   INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
A breach or threatened breach by the client of the provisions of Section 10 ("Ownership and Confidentiality of Intellectual Property") in any respect will be material and will result in substantial and irreparable injury to FA Experts¬Æ.   In the event of a breach or threatened breach of Section 10 of this Agreement, FA Experts¬Æ will be entitled to an injunction restraining the Client therefrom.  This provision shall not be construed as prohibiting FA Experts¬Æ from pursuing any other available remedies for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages.

12.   FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE:
If either FA Experts¬Æ or the client fails in the due performance of any of its obligations under these Terms and Conditions, the other party will have the right, at its election, to sue for damages for such breach and to seek such legal and equitable remedies as may be available to it, including the right to recover all reasonable expenses, which shall include reasonable collections costs, legal fees, and court costs, incurred: (a) to pursue collections, (b) to sue for damages; (c) to seek such other legal and equitable remedies; and (d) to collect any damages and enforce any court order or settlement agreement including, but not limited to, additional application to the court for an order of contempt.  Except for specified limitations on liability (in Section 13) and agreed indemnification provisions (in Section 14), nothing contained herein shall be construed to restrict or impair the rights of either party to exercise this election.  All rights and remedies herein provided or existing at law or in equity shall be cumulative of each other and may be enforced concurrently therewith or from time to time.

13.   WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATION:
FA Experts warrants and represents that the services provided hereunder shall be delivered in a professional manner and in keeping with the standards of performance prevalent in the industry.  FA Experts makes no other warrantees or claims regarding the services provided through the FA WizardTM product.  Specifically, the client understands and agrees that FA Experts¬Æ makes no warranty of regulatory compliance at the client institution based upon the materials and services to be provided through FA WizardTM.  The client understands and agrees that all FA Experts¬Æ services are advisory in nature, and that the client institution maintains full and complete responsibility for regulatory compliance and any associated costs.  Further, the client agrees that the maximum liability for any claim by the client against FA Experts¬Æ related to the operation and outputs of the FA WizardTM product shall be limited to the subscription fees charged to the client and actually paid to FA Experts¬Æ by the client during the ninety-day period prior to legal notice of the claim being presented to FA Experts¬Æ or its attorney.

14.	INDEMNIFICATION:
The client hereby agrees to indemnify and hold FA Experts¬Æ harmless, at all times from and after the beginning date of the Term, from all counter-suits, claims, damages, liability and expense, including legal fees, arising from or in any way connected with the breach by the client of any of these Terms and Conditions, and/or FA Expert's enforcement of its rights under these Terms and Conditions, at law or in equity, including without limitation: (i) suit for damages, (ii) seeking of such other legal and equitable remedies, (iii) collection of any debts and/or damages, and (iv) enforcement of any court order or settlement, including but not limited to additional application to the court for an order of contempt.
